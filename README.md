### About Me
Hi, my name is Jomar Kristoffer L. Besayte. Originally, I started a Web Developer, but I found out that I love to take QA as my long-term career, and I am happy to finally find the path that where I can develop successfully develop myself. I do freelance Web Developing, and apply QA before giving the product to the stakeholders. I am a strong believer of accessibility and equality that's why I want to level up my QA game and make the digital world accessible for everyone. In this portfolio, I will showcase the skills I've learned through online courses, self-study and practice, and during my freelance career. I am fully determined to continuously grow in this field and make the digital world a better place for everyone.
